## Unit test in group project

Pushed a single Testcase file from my local project env for this lab: https://github.com/ECE444-2023Fall/project-1-web-application-design-novatech/blob/main/Tests/app_tests.py 
I am testing the login infra and the event discovery system. There are multiple unit tests

## What are the pros and cons of TDD?

### Pros:
1. **Improved Code Quality:** Writing tests before code ensures that the software is functional and meets requirements from the outset.
2. **Easier Refactoring:** With a suite of tests already in place, developers can refactor or enhance the code with confidence that they aren't introducing new bugs.
3. **Better Collaboration:** TDD can improve communication between developers, as tests define clear acceptance criteria and can serve as documentation.
4. **Reduced Debugging Time:** By catching errors early in the development process, developers spend less time debugging issues in the later stages.

### Cons:
1. **Initial Time Investment:** Writing tests upfront can seem like a slower start compared to diving directly into coding.
2. **Learning Curve:** TDD requires a shift in mindset and can be challenging for developers unfamiliar with the approach.
3. **Potential Over-Testing:** There's a risk of writing unnecessary tests, which can add to the maintenance overhead.
4. **False Sense of Security:** Passing tests don't guarantee that the software is bug-free, especially if the tests aren't comprehensive.
